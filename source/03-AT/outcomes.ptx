A: How can we understand linear maps algebraically?
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
A1: I can
    determine if a map between vector spaces of polynomials is linear or not.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
A2: I can
    translate back and forth between a
    linear transformation of Euclidean spaces and its standard matrix, and
    perform related computations.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
A3: I can
    compute a basis for the kernel and a basis for the image of a linear map, and verify that the rank-nullity theorem holds for a given linear map.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
A4: I can
    determine if a given linear map is injective and/or surjective.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
